## Feature User Story
As a cryptography teacher, I can quickly create and decode Caesar Shift cypher puzzles for my students, so that I can quickly create and grade homework assignments.

## Feature Requirements
<!-- What does this feature have to accomplish? -->
- Must Encode Strings as a Caesar Shift.
    - A ceasar shift is created by taking each letter and increasing its value by 3. So A becomes D, B becomes E, etc.
- Must be able to decode already encoded values
    - A ceasar shift is created by taking each letter and increasing its decreasing its value by 3. So D becomes A, E becomes B, etc.
- X, Y, and Z will never be used, so do not implement an overflow feature at this time.
    - A reverse overflow also doesnt need to be implemented.
- The original string value should only be accessable within the encode/decode class, or not at all.
